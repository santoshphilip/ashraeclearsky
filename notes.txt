Study and act on functionality in coockiecutter
- documentation
    - need stephen's help in
- clean up tests
    - pytest
        - fuck ... tests are failing. I'll have to review all, carefully
    - try to generate documentation.
    - what is pytest-runner
    - see test coverage

quickest effect:

- do a full release to pypi
- to read the docs

cookiecutter uses .editorconfig # http://editorconfig.org
textmate plugin is: https://github.com/Mr0grog/editorconfig-textmate


read up on:
https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
to make full use of cookiecutter
- bumpversion -> bumps up the version of the release software
- autorelease to pypi when there is a new tag on master
- pyup will keep the dependencies updated -> mya want to use the local version
- will run Travis-Cl
- will add the repo to read the docs account

uploaded to pypi - DONE
- see online documentation for how to do this.
- pypi is a fast changing env. -> will have to scramble to do this again.

Next steps
- click package
- test for click
- documentation
    - "make html" generates the html documentation
    - html is in docs/_build/html/index.html
    - docs/_build in in gitignore
- __doc__ documentation
